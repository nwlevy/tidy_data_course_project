##Overview
The data in this analysis comes from Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset compiled by Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, and Luca Oneto.  The original data set can be found at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip .

In short, the researchers asked 30 volunteers to perform six different activities while wearing smart phones on their waists. These activities included walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying.  The experimenters used the embedded accelerometers and gyroscopes within these phones to measure various aspects of the subjects' movements.  

## Variables

Information about the collection methodology for the various movement variables in the raw data can be found in the features_info.txt file listed above.  Each variable measures a particular type of motion and a directional axis.  The motion measurements include velocity, acceleration, and jerk.  The axes include the x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis.  Furthermore, every measurement in the raw data set is normalized on a range of -1 to 1, and the variables therefore have no units.

The data within this analysis is subset of the raw data, including the index number for each volunteer (ranging from 1-30), the activity that he or she performed, and only the measurements within the raw data that were either means or standard deviations. However, many of the volunteers performed certain activities more than once.  Thus, the tidy data set produced by runanalysis.R takes the mean measurement of each variable for each activity that each volunteer performed.  The full list of mean values included for the thirty volunteers and six activities are listed below:
